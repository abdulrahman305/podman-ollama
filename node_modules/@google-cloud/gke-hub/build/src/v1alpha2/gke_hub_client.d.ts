     *
     *         state = CREATING
     * @param {string} [request.orderBy]
     *   Optional. One or more fields to compare and use to sort the output.
     *   See https://google.aip.dev/132#ordering.
     * @param {object} [options]
     *   Call options. See {@link https://googleapis.dev/nodejs/google-gax/latest/interfaces/CallOptions.html|CallOptions} for more details.
     * @returns {Promise} - The promise which resolves to an array.
     *   The first element of the array is Array of {@link protos.google.cloud.gkehub.v1alpha2.Membership|Membership}.
     *   The client library will perform auto-pagination by default: it will call the API as many
     *   times as needed and will merge results from all the pages into this array.
