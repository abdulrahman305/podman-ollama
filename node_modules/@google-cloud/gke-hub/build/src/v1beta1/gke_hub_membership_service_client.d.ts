     * @param {google.protobuf.FieldMask} request.updateMask
     *   Required. Mask of fields to update. At least one field path must be
     *   specified in this mask.
     * @param {google.cloud.gkehub.v1beta1.Membership} request.resource
     *   Required. Only fields specified in update_mask are updated.
     *   If you specify a field in the update_mask but don't specify its value here
     *   that field will be deleted.
     *   If you are updating a map field, set the value of a key to null or empty

     *   value to the empty string.
     *   If you specify the update_mask to be a special path "*", fully replaces all
     *   user-modifiable fields to match `resource`.
     * @param {string} [request.requestId]
     *   Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID
     *   so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore
     *   the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee
     *   that for at least 60 minutes after the first request.
     *
     *   For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
     *   the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request
     *   ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID
     *   was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents
     *   clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.
     *
     *   The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is
     *   not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
     * @param {object} [options]
