     * @param {number} request.pageSize
     *   When requesting a 'page' of resources, `page_size` specifies number of

     * @param {string} request.pageToken
     *   Token returned by previous call to `ListFeatures` which

     *   resources.
     * @param {string} request.filter
     *   Lists Features that match the filter expression, following the syntax
     *   outlined in https://google.aip.dev/160.

     *   Examples:
     *

     *
     *         name = "projects/foo-proj/locations/global/features/servicemesh"

     *
     *         labels.foo = bar
     * @param {string} request.orderBy
     *   One or more fields to compare and use to sort the output.
     *   See https://google.aip.dev/132#ordering.
     * @param {object} [options]
     *   Call options. See {@link https://googleapis.dev/nodejs/google-gax/latest/interfaces/CallOptions.html|CallOptions} for more details.
     * @returns {Stream}
     *   An object stream which emits an object representing {@link protos.google.cloud.gkehub.v1beta.Feature|Feature} on 'data' event.
     *   The client library will perform auto-pagination by default: it will call the API as many
     *   times as needed. Note that it can affect your quota.
     *   We recommend using `listFeaturesAsync()`
     *   method described below for async iteration which you can stop as needed.
     *   Please see the {@link https://github.com/googleapis/gax-nodejs/blob/master/client-libraries.md#auto-pagination | documentation }
