# Ollama Modelfile for Self-Maintaining k8sgpt Language Model

# Description:
# This model leverages k8sgpt for a self-maintaining language model within Kubernetes.

# Key Features:
# - Kubernetes Integration: Efficient resource management, scalability, and fault tolerance.
# - k8sgpt Integration: Seamless deployment and management of GPT models in Kubernetes.
# - Self-Maintenance: Minimizes user intervention with automated best-practice maintenance.
# - High Performance & Scalability: Delivers exceptional performance and adapts to workloads.
# - High Availability: Ensures continuous operation through redundancy and fault tolerance.

# Target Base Model:
FROM llama3

# Model Parameters:
PARAMETER temperature 0.99  # Adjust creativity vs. coherence (higher = more creative)
PARAMETER num_ctx 4096  # Context window size (controls how much history the model uses)

# Define maintenance interval (in seconds)
MAINTENANCE_INTERVAL = 3600  # 1 hour

        time.sleep(10)

        time.sleep(10)
        logging.info("Hyperparameters optimized.")
    except Exception as e:
